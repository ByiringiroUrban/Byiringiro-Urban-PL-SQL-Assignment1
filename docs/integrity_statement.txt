# WISE Academy Database Project Documentation

---

## Problem Definition

WISE Academy, an e-learning company, needs to analyze its sales and enrollment data from the **Customers**, **Products**, and **Transactions** tables. The specific business problems include:

* Identifying the top-selling products (courses) per region and quarter.
* Measuring month-to-month revenue growth across courses.
* Segmenting customers into quartiles based on their total spend.
* Tracking cumulative sales trends to monitor long-term progress.
* Detecting long-term performance through moving averages.

These insights will help management make measurable, data-driven decisions about marketing, promotions, student retention, and resource allocation.

**Expected measurable outcomes:**

* Ranked list of top 5 products per region and quarter.
* Running monthly totals of sales by region.
* Month-over-month revenue growth percentages.
* Customer segmentation into quartiles for targeted campaigns.
* Moving averages to identify long-term sales and enrollment trends.

## Business Context

WISE Academy is a private education technology institution based in Rwanda. It provides online programming and digital skills training to students and professionals. The **Sales & Marketing Department** is responsible for promoting courses, acquiring new students, and retaining existing learners. By analyzing transactions using **Oracle SQL window functions**, WISE Academy can:

* Optimize its marketing campaigns with data-driven insights.
* Identify high-value students and reward or target them for further learning opportunities.
* Improve financial forecasting and detect trends in course popularity and revenue growth.
* Ensure better allocation of instructors and classroom resources.

## How the Project Works

This project demonstrates how an **Oracle relational database** with window functions can address the above problems. The workflow includes:

1. **Database Schema**: Creating normalized tables for customers, products (courses), and transactions.
2. **Data Loading**: Inserting sample records to simulate sales and enrollment data.
3. **Window Function Queries**:

   * Ranking functions (`ROW_NUMBER`, `DENSE_RANK`) to identify top customers or products.
   * Aggregate window functions (`SUM OVER`) to calculate cumulative revenue.
   * Navigation functions (`LAG`, `LEAD`) to measure growth between months.
   * Distribution functions (`NTILE`, `CUME_DIST`) to segment students/customers.
   * Moving averages to analyze long-term sales patterns.
4. **Analysis & Reporting**: Queries generate insights for the management team to guide strategy.

This approach ensures better decision-making, reduces errors compared to spreadsheets, and supports scalable reporting.
